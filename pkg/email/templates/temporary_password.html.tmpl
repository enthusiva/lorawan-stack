<p>
Dear {{ .ReceiverName }},
</p>
<p>
A temporary password was requested for your user <code>{{ .Receiver.Ids.IDString }}</code> on <b>{{ .Network.Name }}</b>.
</p>
<p>
You can now visit <a href="{{ .Network.IdentityServerURL }}/update-password?user={{ .Receiver.Ids.IDString }}&current={{ .TemporaryPassword }}">this link</a> to change your password.
Alternatively, you can use the temporary password <code>{{ .TemporaryPassword }}</code> directly.
Please note that this temporary password can only be used to change your password, you can not use it to log in.
</p>
{{- with .TTL }}
<p>
Your temporary password expires {{ relTime . }}, so if you don't change your password before then, you'll have to request a new temporary password if you still want to change your password.
